\section{Problem 3 – Minimum AVL Tree / Fibonacci Tree}

Setting: $T_n$ stands for AVL tree of height $n$.
Denote $N(n)$ for number of nodes in $T_n$.

\paragraph{Question 1}
20

\paragraph{Question 2}
\begin{equation*}
    N(n) = N(n-1) + N(n-2) + 1 
\end{equation*}

Bonus: note that $N(n) = Fib_{n+3} - 1$  where $Fib_0 = 0$.
Proof goes by induction: 
$N(0) = 1 = 2 - 1 = Fib_3 - 1$, 
$N(1) = 2 = 3 - 1 = Fib_4 - 1$.
Inductive step:
\begin{equation*}
N(n) = N(n-1) + N(n-2) + 1 = (Fib_{n+2} - 1) + (Fib_{n+1} - 1) + 1 = Fib_{n+3}-1    
\end{equation*}


\paragraph{Question 3}
Note that $r^n = r^{n-1} + r^{n-2}$.
To see that start with:
\begin{equation*}
 r^2 = (\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2})^2 = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2} + 1 = r+1   
\end{equation*}
and multiply it by $r^{n-2}$ both sides.

The rest goes by induction. 
Base case: $N(0) = 1 \geq r^0$, $N(1) = 2 > r^1$.
Inductive step:
\begin{equation*}
    N(n) = N(n-1) + N(n-2) + 1 \geq r^{n-1} + r^{n-2} = r^n
\end{equation*}

% \paragraph{Failed attempt: Question 4}
% Full binary tree of height $n$ has $2^{n+1} - 1$ nodes.
% Of course $T_n$ of height $n$ has fewer nodes than the full binary tree: $N(n) \leq 2^{n+1} -1$.
% Notice, that the deepest level of $T_n$ consist of only one node:
% that's because $T_0$ has one node and $T_n$ is made out of $T_{n-1}$ and $T_{n-2}$ (and a root – try to depict that).
% Thus, we can do even better approximation:
% $T_n$ has fewer nodes than full binary tree of height n-1 plus one node:
% \begin{equation*}
%     N(n) \leq 2^{n+1-1} - 1 + 1 = 2^n 
% \end{equation*}
% Still not quite good...

\paragraph{Question 4}
Again, by induction. 
Base: tree of height $0$ has $1< r^2$ nodes.
Induction:
\begin{equation*}
    N(n) = 1 + N(n-1) + N(n-2) \leq 1 + r^{n+1} + r^{n} = r^{n+2} + 1
\end{equation*}
